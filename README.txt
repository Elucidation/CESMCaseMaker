CESMCaseMaker
---------------------------------------------
CESM stands for the Community Earth System Model (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/)
used for running simulations of the earth's climate.

The goal of CESMCaseMaker is to present a visual interface to creation new CESM simulations.

It does this by:
-Presenting a web interface for choosing new case options.
-Populating a template script from those options, and returns the filled out script
-This script can be run in the main CESM directory to create a new CESM case.

Short and sweet.

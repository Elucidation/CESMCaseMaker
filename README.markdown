CESM Case Maker
---

The goal of CESMCaseMaker is to present a visual interface to creating new of [CESM simulations](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/).

It does this by:
-Presenting a web interface for choosing new CESM case configuration options.
-Generating a shell script automating the configuration, building and launching of a new CESM simulation.

A live demo was previously up on Amazon EC2, but that costs money to keep going. For now here is a screenshot, or you can download the code and run it locally.
